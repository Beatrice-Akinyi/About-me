        <h2>My school</h2>
        <p>joska school is located along kangundo road machakos county.</p>

        <p> Its approximately 20 miles from Nairobi. It serves a community of approximately 70,000 people. The school was started on September 3, 2007 allowing more room for other children who were on a waiting list to join MOHI program.<br></p>
        <p>Being a boarding school, the children in the center experience a safer, more controlled learning environment, allowing for increased spiritual care away from negative influences from the slum.</p>
        <p>Our center though steps in for some community needs like: medical care, spiritual development, education and farming Godâ€™s way.</p>
        <p>  Vulnerable children from the surrounding community were also recruited into the program. The center provides quality christian education to the vulnerable children hence shining hope on their futures.</p>
